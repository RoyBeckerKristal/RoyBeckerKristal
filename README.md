- 👋 Hi, I’m Roy Becker-Kristal
- 👀 I’m interested in data- and patter-driven approaches to many things, from speech and language (I have PhD in linguistics) through sociology and politics to demographics, and even music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science and machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that combines machine learning approaches with deep interest in data characteristic of an interesting subject matter.
